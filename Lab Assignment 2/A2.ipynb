    "Logistic Regression and Linear SVC deliver the best overall performance, achieving accuracies of 87% and 86% respectively, and showing strong results on the positive sentiment class. However, both models struggle significantly with the neutral class, with recall dropping to just 18% for Logistic Regression and 11% for Linear SVC. Naive Bayes, while simple and efficient, performs poorly on negative and neutral sentiments, tending to overpredict the positive class. Among the lexicon-based approaches, VADER outperforms TextBlob, showing higher accuracy and better recall for positive sentiments, but both fall short in accurately detecting negative and neutral reviews. In general, machine learning models outperform lexicon-based ones, but identifying neutral sentiment remains a consistent challenge across all methods."
